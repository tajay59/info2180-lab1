<h2>Tajay Edwards</h2>
<p>I am an Electronics Engineer in training and I have developed a deep interest in the field of Science and Technology over the years. Most of time is spent on coding and designing electronic devices, and watching movies.  I research and develop Internet of Things (IoT) solutions using Embedded systems,as a hobbyist and also professionally. One of the stages in developing IoT systems involves create User Interfaces, to allow clients to interract with the system and this is why I am intereted in web development.</p>
